DevOps engineers work on Agile development teams with other developers 
and foundation architects. They design the application build, including
 suggesting the simplest and most cost-effective system options. Most 
 importantly, these engineers create automated development practices to e
 nsure architecture standardization for faster development processes. 
 Additionally, they improve processes for delivering software to customers.
 This includes updates, because DevOps engineers
 test prototypes throughout the development and delivery processes to 
 identify operational issues and automate fixes for those bugs.

Job responsibilities of a DevOps engineer include:

Creating style guides for software and applications
Maintaining company goals for the product's performance
Tracking bottlenecking issues with the deployment of programs
and updates
Understanding tools such as Bamboo, Chef, and Puppet
Build and Release Engineers
Build and release engineers create and maintain an infrastructure, 
often called a source control system or build system, full of tools
 and frameworks that will make the job of software building and deployment 
 easier. As part of this system, they design scripts and tools used for software
 development that use Python or even Java programming and scripting to create source code.
 Part of their job is to seamlessly integrate updates of the software using continuous delivery pipelines, 
 which will take the updates to the user faster.
